-- Source of the data: docs/naming/retired-names.txt (one retired name per line;
-- blank lines and lines beginning '#' are ignored). Each retired name is proved
-- here to be something a Julia package could never have been called, which is
-- why it had to be retired rather than adopted.
--
-- The refutation goes through IdentifierCharset.charset-excludes with the name's
-- tail given by name, or through the leading-character rule when the offending
-- character is the first one. Matching legal-stop is safe at this call site and
-- is not safe in a general lemma: here the index is a literal list from the
-- register, so the witness types come out concrete and Agda has no variable index
-- to split. See the comment in IdentifierCharset.agda.
--
-- The names in this module are transcribed by the generator; every obligation
-- below is decided by Agda when the module is typechecked. A wrong name is a
-- type error, not a warning.
